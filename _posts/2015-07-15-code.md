This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in JavaScript.
All you have to do is wrap your code in markdown code tags:

````markdown
```javascript
code code code
````
```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598). You must indent your code by **(3 \* bullet_indent_level)** spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:

````markdown
1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.

   1. Like this:

      ```javascript
      function greet(name) {
          console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
      }

      greet("World");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
````
